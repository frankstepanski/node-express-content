## REST Methods, Postman and MVC

### Postman

Postman is a tool that allows you to test your API endpoints. It is a great tool to use when you are developing your API. 
It allows you to test your endpoints and see the responses that you get back. It also allows you to test different HTTP methods and see how your API responds to them.
